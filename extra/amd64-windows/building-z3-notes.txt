Make sure to use python scripts/mk_make.py -x --java
(-x for 64 bit, --java to build the 2nd DLL)

Make sure to include both DLLs!

Note that, to build 64-bit DLL, you need to be in Visual Studio's 64-bit command line (grep on "x64 native").

To find dependencies, may need to add the DLL directory to the user's PATH as well as Java Classpath. See:
